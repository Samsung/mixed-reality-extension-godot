## Installation instructions
Requires **Unity 2018.1** or later. Tested on Windows, WebGL, Android and iOS.

You can install Procedural Toolkit from any of the following sources:

1. Import from the [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/procedural-toolkit-16508)
2. Download from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit/releases). Same packages as in the Asset Store.
3. Clone/download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Syomus/ProceduralToolkit) and put it in a subfolder (preferably `/Assets/ProceduralToolkit`).

If you have any previous versions of the toolkit installed it is highly recommended to delete them before importing a newer version.

Renaming or moving toolkit's folder from the default path (`/Assets/ProceduralToolkit`) will break .cginc includes in the example shaders, otherwise it is safe to move the toolkit however you want.

The folder containing example classes and scenes (`ProceduralToolkit/Examples`) can be safely removed. The same is true for `ProceduralToolkit/Shaders`, if you are not using examples.

### Getting started
After installation you can import ProceduralToolkit namespace and start building your own PCG systems:
```C#
using UnityEngine;
using ProceduralToolkit;

public class ReadmeExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void Update()
    {
        Debug.Log(string.Format("<color=#{0}>{0}</color>", RandomE.colorHSV.ToHtmlStringRGB()));
    }
}
```
